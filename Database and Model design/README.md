## Approach

We have separate tables for Providers and Clients, each with their own attributes.
To connect providers and clients in a many-to-many relationship, we introduce the ClientProvider join table.
For clients' journal entries, we create the JournalEntry table. Please see 'Database_and_Model_design.rb' file.

### Pros of the Approach

ðŸ”¸ Flexibility: Our approach allows for flexible relationships between providers and clients. Clients can have multiple providers, and providers can have multiple clients, accommodating various scenarios.

ðŸ”¸ Scalability: Our design can scale well as the number of providers and clients grows. The join table provides a scalable solution for managing the relationships.

ðŸ”¸ Separation of Concerns: Each table represents a distinct entity (provider, client, journal entry), promoting a separation of concerns and organization in the database structure.

ðŸ”¸ Easy Querying: With the defined associations, it becomes straightforward to perform queries such as finding all clients for a particular provider or all providers for a particular client.

### Cons of the Approach

ðŸ”¸ Increased Complexity: The introduction of a join table adds some complexity to the database design. It requires managing the relationships and ensuring data integrity.

ðŸ”¸ Additional Queries: Retrieving specific information that involves joining tables may require additional queries or more complex SQL statements.

ðŸ”¸ Maintenance: The design may require additional effort to maintain and update, especially if changes are made to the relationships between providers, clients, or plans.
